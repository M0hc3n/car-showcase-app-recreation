## Details
This project is part of [jsmastery course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUNSHPyVryU) on Next and Typescript. Follow him for more of such content on **Webdev**.

## API
the API throughout this project is [RapidAPI cars](https://rapidapi.com/apininjas/api/cars-by-api-ninjas), it provides a rich dataset of cars with many useful features that can be exploited for a lot of use cases!

# Authentication
I have added the authentication part to the original website. Although I have not exploited it, it can be developed to allow users to add their preferred cars or even their own cars to the website.
To ease up development and learn more about **Next-Auth**, I have used **Google Auth API** to handle authentication.

## What I have learned:
  This mini-project allowed me to learn and boost my skills in the follwing:
- Next
- Typescript
- Tailwind CSS
- Google Auth API
